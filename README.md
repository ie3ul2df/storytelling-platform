# 📚 Storygram

A Django-based storytelling platform where users collaboratively create, manage, and rate community-driven stories. Storygram empowers writers to contribute individual chapters, explore creative story branches, and engage with others through a shared narrative experience.

## 🎯 Project Purpose & Rationale

**Storygram** is designed for writers, readers, and storytelling enthusiasts who want to collaboratively build narratives in a flexible, branching format. It is ideal for users who enjoy sharing creative writing, exploring alternate story paths, and rating each other's contributions.

This application was built as part of the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development to demonstrate full-stack development skills using Django. The project aligns with real-world practices such as user authentication, CRUD operations, relational database modeling, and deployment to a cloud platform (Heroku).

Storygram solves the problem of fragmented creative collaboration by offering a centralised platform where users can:

- Create and contribute to shared stories, one chapter at a time.
- View and rate different versions of chapters created by other contributors.
- Organise stories into coherent branches while encouraging community participation.

The project demonstrates key backend development skills expected by assessors and employers, including:

- A responsive and accessible UX.
- Secure data management.
- Clean, PEP8-compliant Python code.
- Clear documentation and version control practices.

## 🧠 UX & UI Design

### 1. Strategy

#### 🎯 User Goals

The primary user goals for _Storygram_ are to:

- Empower users to write and share original stories chapter by chapter.
- Encourage collaboration by enabling other users to contribute to ongoing stories.
- Guide narrative direction through community-based chapter ranking.
- Provide control to story owners over visibility (public/private) and contribution permissions.
- Support intuitive navigation and access to engaging, top-rated stories.
- Offer profile management and secure session handling for all users.

**Business/Educational Goals:**

- Demonstrate full-stack web development skills.
- Apply UX principles for real-world, user-centred design.
- Showcase coding proficiency and project planning for assessment and potential employers.

### Scope

The project includes the following core features:

- User authentication (register, login, logout).
- Story creation with title, image, description, and collaboration settings.
- Chapter creation and rating system (1–5 stars).
- Visibility settings for stories (public/private).
- Editable/deletable content for authors.
- Filtering and sorting stories on the homepage.

Planned or future features:

- Comment system.
- Follow/favourite authors and stories.
- Notification system for new contributions and ratings.

### Structure

The platform follows a simple, intuitive structure:

## 🐞 Known Issues & Fixes

### 📌 Dynamic Chapter Carousel Bug

**Issue:**  
All chapters were stacked vertically instead of sliding like a carousel.

**Cause:**

- Multiple `.active` classes or none caused Bootstrap to break.
- Parent chapter duplicated outside and inside the carousel.

**Fix:**

- Unified all chapters (parent + children) under one `.carousel-inner`.
- Marked exactly one slide as `.active` (either the highest-rated or the first).
- Conditional rendering of controls (only if multiple slides exist).
- Used `forloop.counter` to show "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", etc.
- Removed parentheses from Django template logic to avoid `TemplateSyntaxError`.

### 📌 AJAX Star Rating Sync Error

**Issue:**

- Stars highlighted in reverse.
- Ratings were stored but not reflected dynamically.
- Carousel didn't auto-load the highest-rated chapter.
- Some `innerText` updates failed.

**Fix:**

- Refactored JS to handle left-to-right star highlights.
- DOM updates synced using class-based selectors (`.avg`, `.count`).
- Sorted chapters server-side in `views.py` by rating.
- Updated template to render a single sorted list with correct active class.

**Result:**  
AJAX-powered rating now updates stars, average, and user count live. Highest-rated chapter loads first.

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⭐ Total ranking logic   | Averaged top chapters from each season; passed into templates.                      |
| 🎛️ Button permissions    | Used conditional logic based on user roles to show/hide edit/contribute options.    |
| 🧩 Nested template logic | Simplified blocks and used clearer variable naming.                                 |
| 🧪 Delete confirmation   | Added dialog to prevent accidental story/chapter deletions.                         |
| 🧍 Author visibility     | Used `user == chapter.author` to show personal edit/delete buttons.                 |
| 🖼️ Image uploads         | Configured `MEDIA_URL`, `MEDIA_ROOT`, and used `{% if image %}` checks.             |

| 🧵 Carousel sync         | Synced indicators and content to avoid JS errors.                                   |
